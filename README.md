# ðŸ§  synaptik-core (WIP)

**Toward Trustworthy AGI â€” a lightweight cognitive architecture for ethical, agentic intelligence.**


## What is synaptik-core?

`synaptik-core` is an experimental cognitive framework that combines **LLMs**, **symbolic reasoning**, and **moral contract enforcement** to create agents that are:

- Ethically aligned  
-  Memory-capable (stateful)  
- âš¡ Edge-deployable  
-  Auditable and interpretable

This project addresses key limitations in modern AI: statelessness, hallucination, lack of transparency, and ethical ambiguity.

##  Architecture Overview

The system is built on three core layers:

| Component          | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DAG Memory**     | A Directed Acyclic Graph for long-term, symbolic memory and planning.       |
| **SQLite Cache**   | A synthetic hippocampus for fast recall of recent interactions.             |
| **Moral Contracts**| Declarative, enforceable ethical rules evaluated by a dedicated agent.      |

These are managed by modular, collaborative agents:

- **Ethos Agent** â€“ Evaluates prompts and actions against moral contracts  
- **Librarian Agent** â€“ Retrieves and indexes memory  
- **Memory Agent** â€“ Handles caching, pruning, and DAG updates  
- **Execution Agent** â€“ Generates responses and takes actions  
- **Audit Agent** â€“ Logs key decisions to an immutable ledger or cold storage  


## Use Cases

- AI safety research  
- Explainable AI (XAI) systems  
- Cognitive agents for sensitive domains (health, education, law)  
- Memory-augmented LLMs for edge devices  

## Tech Stack

| Tech                | Role                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rust / Python**   | Core logic implementation (currently WIP in Rust; Python used for prototypes and orchestration)                              |
| **SQLite**          | Fast-access working memory for recent or frequently used information                                                         |
| **IPFS**            | Cold memory archiving. Used to offload large or infrequently accessed nodes and audit logs to a decentralized storage layer. |
| **DAG**             | Immutable memory graph. Planned as a tamper-proof audit trail of agent decisions, ethical evaluations, and memory updates.   |
| **OpenAI** | LLM-based reasoning and generation. Handles reflection, inference, and dialog components within the agentic system.          |


## ðŸš§ Project Status

`synaptik-core` is in **early development**. The current prototype demonstrates:

- The current prototype demonstrates a limited DAG-based symbolic memory that supports adding, retrieving, and pruning memory nodes

##  Vision

This is a step toward cognitive agents that can **remember**, **reason**, and **act with integrity** even in ambiguous, real-world contexts.
